# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a modern take on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, developed as a personal learning exercise using vanilla JavaScript. It features real-time turn logic, interactive sound effects, and a celebratory confetti animation on winning. Designed with modular code structure and playful UI elements, it's a small but polished frontend project showcasing DOM manipulation and event-driven logic in action.
